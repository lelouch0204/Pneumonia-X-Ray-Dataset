# Pneumonia-X-Ray-Dataset
My try at analyzing a Dataset containing X rays of Pneumonia patients. It was a binary classification project and we had to determine whether or not the patient had Pneumonia. Used the dataset from Kaggle.
For the task I used the FastAI library for building and training the model. Used a ResNet50 and a Resnet34 model and experimented with various types of data augmentations. Managed to achieve accuracy of 96.7% with the ResNet50 architecture
